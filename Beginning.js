//javascript start

//before you start i would recommend you to install quokka.js extension. to start the extention pres control + shift + p and select "Quokka.js Start on current file"
//you cant run quokka if the code has problems
//with a double // can you create comments if you have a red thing on this code just put // infront of it

//with those you can start doing variables
//var       //i wouldnt recommend var cuz its confusing
//let       //use let instead of var cuz only one variable name can be put in unlike var
//const     //const are for variables that shouldnt get changed 

//here are some examples
var myVar = 10;
var myVar = 5;
//the result will be 5 we can check this with a consol.log
console.log(myVar)

//this gives you an error becouse you can have 2 lets with the same name
let myLet = 20;
let myLet = 10;

//The Value of an let is changeble
let myNewLet = 10
myNewLet = 5
//the value of this let is now 5
console.log(myNewLet)

//const are unchangeble variables you cant have the same name either
const myConst = 4;
const myConst = 5;

const myNewConst = 6;
myNewConst = 2;
console.log(myNewConst)
