//Primitive data types are the basic types which point to a concrete unchangeable value. The most important ones are listed below

// String
// Number
// Boolean
// BigInt
// Undefined
// Null

//Here are some examples

// String

const userName = "Erdabi";

// Number

const smallNumber = 4;
const floatNumber = 4.5; //floats are numbers with numbers after the dot .080

//in javascript you dont have to write if its a float or a normal int. Number is Number with or without dot

//Boolean

//Booleans are True or False values

const isTrue = true;
const isFalse = false;

//BigInt
//as said its all automatic no need to write if its a big or normal number

const bigNumber = 3456433567435473278;

//undefined

const notDefined = undefined;

//null

const emptyObject = null;

//undefined and Null aint the same thing its kinda hard to understand there is a picture in the repository that explains it very well
